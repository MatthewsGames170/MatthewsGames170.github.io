		<p>There are 8 games;</p>
		<ol><!--In order of creation -->
			<li>Not-so-flappy Dot - A game where you dodge incoming obstacles.</li>
			<li>Wack-a-character - Wack-a-mole, but you can change what you are whacking</li>
			<li>Dot Man - A remake of Pac Man</li>
			<li>Mine Sweeper - Is very similar to the game it is meant to be</li>		
			<li>Tetris - Based of the game of the same name. </li>
			<li>Snake - A terrible version of snake, based on the python version</li>
			<li>Wordle - A variation of the Well known game</li>
			<li>Tron - A two-player game, but is very simple</li>
			<li style="display:none">Space Shooter - A cross between galiga and asteroids</li>
			
		</ol>
		<br>
		<p>
			I would not recommend playing wack-a. I started it, but never got round to finishing it.
		</p>
		<p>
			I would like to point out that, especially for Dot Man and Not-so-flappy Dot, the 'lag' 
			/ stop-go running of the games is not your computer. 
			The way that I designed the games to work has the side effect of this occurring. 
		</p>
		<br><Br>
		<p>
			I hope to make more games or HTML/JavaScript related Things, and add them here in the future.<br>
			However, as the second of prelims approaches, and my time left at school running out, it 
			is unlikely any new games or features would be added here.

			<p>This Website was made by <b>Matthew Cole</b> during late 2021 and early 2022</p>
			<!--first version was made during November 2021, but was continued to be edited into December-->
			<p>It was designed to allow the game 'not-so-flappy dot' to be 
			connected to its random section generator, which would require pHp, but I have not done this.</p>
			
			<p>However, I have used the website as a platform for several other games as well.</p>
			
			<p>For the 'Not-so-flappy Dot' game, I would like to Give Special 
			Thanks to Andrew Twigg, who not only Cut to code of the game 
			down by at least 3500 lines, but he added in the High scores 
			and, most importantly, allows the game to adjust its width 
			depending on the screen size.
			<br>Ultimately, this little bit of code was able to reduce 
			the size of each of my game down quite considerably<br>
			However, I have since found another way that I prefer to use.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				However, today, including comments and empty lines, it is about <b>22300</b> lines of code!
			</p><!-- or, new estimates are at 9615-->
			<!-- Dot man would have been at least 5000 lines longer, Tetris another 3500, wack-a character 200, Minesweaper 1200-->

			<p>
				I should probable also give credit to W3 Schools, 
				a website that teaches about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
				pHp and many other languages. This was where I went 
				to find several bits of code and learned most of the 
				JavaScript and pHp I know today. Also, most of the obscure 
				CSS properties I found here.

			<h2>History</h2>
			
			<p>The game, 'not-so-flappy' dot, was first made during June 2021. 
			I, Matthew, created the game on a 5 by 5 pixel Microbit, and had it 
			working well. </p>
			
			<p>I tried to expand the game, but was stopped by the storage limit on a Microbit</p>
			
			<p>This led me to think about putting it onto a webpage, using JavaScript to connected it to HTML. 
			However, over the summer holidays, this was never made and after the summer, I did some work with pHp</p>
			
			<p>During October and November 2021, I began to make the website 
			version of the game. After re-writing the entire code, as the JavaScript and the
			Microbit code were not compatible, and a lot of frustrated staring at squares to change, I got it to work. </p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="nov21">
			
			<h3>November 2021</h3>
			
			<p>The first step was getting the 20 by 8 grid of 'Dots' to exist and turn on and off. This involved the creation of a 
			plot and unplot function which would determine the coordinate of the dot selected then toggle that one to a specified colour.
			These 3 functions (on, off and player) each consisted of about 500 lines of code. </p>
			
			<p>Once these core functions were made, I had to start making them appear in a pattern, which was not so difficult as 
			I had already done it on the Microbit. And very quickly I had a running pattern, which at the <span onclick="TimerC()">time</span> would repeat.</p>
			
			<p>The next step was the Player interactivity. At first this was just a few buttons on the page that you 
			had to click with the mouse but this soon became too slow for me. I then experimented with keyboard events and was able to 
			have the keyboard do the same job as the buttons. The Buttons still remain there, in case it is ever use on a touch 
			screen device, making it the only one of my games that is compatible. </p>
			
			<p onclick="L()">As this was now working, it attracted the attention of several people.</p>
			
			<p>One of these people was Andrew Twigg, who has had some brilliant Ideas on how to shorten my code and make it do things 
			I want it to do, but I had never been able to do</p>
			
			<p>He managed to reduce the size of my plot functions to about 5 lines of code each. He also found a way to store the high scores. 
			I however, expanded this to create the High scores table and the names that are here today</p>
		
		</section>
		
		<section id="dec21">
			
			<h3>December 2021</h3>
			
			<p>After making 'not-so-flappy Dot', I wanted to make more of these games, so I began working on two, with two more ideas
			in the making.</p>
			
			<p>The first of these, Wack-a-character, was inspired by my brothers 'Wack-a-Boris' game that he had made during his S3 
			computing. I wanted to make something similar, but more varied, so I made wack-a-character.</p>
			
			<p>This, however, was left behind after getting the basic game running, which it still is at the time of writing. 
			As Prelims had finished and now I wanted to make some sort of Pac-Man</p>
			
			<p>At first, no-one knew exactly what I was working on, and if asked, I would say 'Secret Project', but after the player started to work, 
			people managed to guess it and I told them what it was. </p>
			
			<p>At first, there was some errors in the plotting functions, but that was overcome quickly. The main problems were the ghosts. 
			I had no real idea on how to get them to move about, never mind going towards the player. </p>
			
			<p>My first step was to get 4 ghosts running around randomly, not aiming for the player at any point.
			This helped me develop the functions to go around corners or junctions, which although it chooses a random direction, 
			the function for the direction could be edited to make the ghost choose the direction which is heads towards the player</p>
			
			<img src="Z_Images/dotMan.jpg" width="49%" style="float:right;padding:5px"  onclick="r('Edge is BAD!')" alt="Dotman Game play">
			
			
			<p>The first ghost to run without getting 'stuck' or produce errors first ran in late morning of the 24<sup>th</sup> of December 2021, 
			With the other three given the same random movement later that day</p>
			
			<p>Over the remaining days of 2021, I managed to get the Red ghost to have a code that allowed it to follow the player.
			This one would favour going the direction that would decrease the distance between the two of them.
			The pink one was given a third sort of code, which was the same as the Red's code, but opposite favouring mechanisms.
			(Where the red would favour left, the pink would favour up).
			</p>
			<p><i  onclick="r('<i>italics</i>')">If you wish to know how I got the ghosts to work, visit the STEM write up page or open up the file.</i></p>
			<p>
				During this time, I also got the 'coins' to display smaller than the player. <br>
				This was done by giving it a radial colour - basically the colour changed. The inner 2 colours are the same,
				and the one I want to display. The final colour is black, the background colour.
			</p>
			
		</section>
		
		<section id="jan22">
			<h3>January 2022</h3>
			
			<p>At the beginning of January, there were a few bugs to sort out, 
			such as the ghosts would crash the game if they went too far right.
			The ghosts were also unable to go through the teleporter.
			</p>
			<p>
				Both of these were fixed as they were errors relating to the code that teleports the player.				
			</p>
			<p>By the 10<sup>th</sup> of this month, I started to work on the Die and power up parts of the game.<br> on this date,
			I made functions to make the ghosts run away from the player. By accident, this was too good. it was nearly impossible 
			for the player to ever catch the ghosts. <br>All this function was the same one of making the ghosts come towards you,
			but every direction was reversed. if it wanted to go left, it went right.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Before this time, Dot-Man had a playing area of the entire screen. However, when trying to add in
			a display area for the Score and lives, I could not add them in without losing some game play area.
			Instead, I create a smaller map. <span  onclick="r('T<br><br>T is for Tomato<br>T is for T')">T</span>his map is about halve the original size, but conveniently appears
			to fit a very similar map to the original game. This was also the only map that I felt happy as a map, so
			it was used.	
			</p>
			
			<p>
				On the 13<sup onclick="r('SUPER! script')">th</sup>, 'Dot-Man' became a proper game, with all unnecessary keyboard controls
				requiring admin privileges. The game was given a high score function and a button to press play
				the next day.
				<br><Br>
				This was also the same day that I stared to create a responsive navigation bar, which would 
				adjust when the width of the screen was changed
	
			</p>
			
			<p>
				On the 17<sup>th</sup> I managed to get the responsive navigational bar to work. This works by measuring the width of 
				the window each time the viewport is resized. If the width is less than about 1100 pixels, it switches to the
				smaller navigational bar. You can then click the 'More' button to have a sort of drop-down list that 
				allows you to choose which page to access. However, on this day, the drop-down menu is not quite right. 
				If the page is the play or code description, where there is a side menu, the side menu covers the main menu
			</p>
			<img src="Z_Images/minesweaper.jpg" width="49%" alt="minesweeper game play" style="float:right;padding:5px"  onclick="r('Shouldn`t you be doing some sort of revision?<br><br><br>Oh. wait...<br><br>Its me that should be doing maths revision!')"><!-- TRUE! at the time of writing, I shoudl be revision for my adv higher maths pater 2 that is tomorrow morning!-->			
			
			<p>
				After this, I deemed Dot man to be complete and started working on my next project. By popular vote, it was minesweeper.
				The main issue of this would be to have a function that cleared the tiles nearby to where you clicked.<br>

			</p>

			<p>
				This was based on the actual Mine sweeper game and I think that is was a very good 
				remake of it. This was the first project that has a actual use of a function that calls itself. This was to remove the
				tiles around it. <br>
			</p>
			<p>
				This project was working within <b  onclick="r('<B>BOLD</B>')">11</b> days!
			</p>
			<p>
				I stared by using another of my simple projects that creates the HTML code for a table. After that I created the plotting functions.
				<br>
				The mines are hidden through a few functions that create a list of positions where mines are, then the positions are set in
				the records that contains the actual things beneath the tiles. A third function runs to count up the numbers.
				<br>
				The Cascading revel function uncovers the specified position then, if and only if, it does not have a number or mine under it, 
				it runs itself again on all the surrounding tiles. I had some issue with this at first as it did not clear the surrounding tiles and, 
				after I solved that, it kept reoccurring until it ran out of memory
			</p>
			<p>
				At the very end of January, I started to fix some of the Errors/Issues with the Minesweeper game. <br>
				The flags could also be placed on empty tiles, and this was very quickly fixed.
				The next issue was the fact that when you first click, the mines could be there. General feedback suggests that people do not 
				like this so I began working to fix it.
			
			</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="feb22">
			<h3>February 2022</h3>
			<p>
				Minesweeper had a few bugs at the beginning of the month, mainly at the end of the game. 
				These hopefully have now been fixed. Also, from the feedback, the mines no longer seem to 
				appear at or near where you first click. I also started to try and make new Levels, but the drop down 
				box is not working well, so these are not in the game.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a reward for reading this, I will include a way of cheating most of my games. When I was testing the 
				game, I used the Developer tools offered by Chrome. This includes a variety of tools, such as a debugger 
				for JavaScript. There was also the 'console' tool that errors would pop up into or you could get the code
				to print something to it, similar to the alert function but would not stop the execution of the code.
				This allowed me to see what the code was doing. However, it is not a one-way process. You could type in 
				a relevant line of code, such as score = score + 1, and the code would actually execute this line of code 
				and your score would increase by 1. So if you know a few bits of JavaScript, you could theoretically cheat. 
				How do you think I got the high score on Dot Man to be infinity?
			</p>
			<p>
				To find this, right click on the page, and click inspect. This brings up a section in the right-hand side. 
				The bottom, empty, box is the console, type stuff here to cheat. If using Minesweeper, right-click does not 
				bring up this menu. Instead, click the 3 dots in the top-right. Go down to more tools, then developer tools.
				This brings up the same menu.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before you question why I would include how to do such a thing, I did it so that users know that I am 
				aware of it. I have tried to resolve the issue, but seeing as you can simple just input any command, 
				then I cannot find a way of disabling it

				This month, I also started making Tetris. I started by create a table and getting a group of 'dots' to 
				move as one. This was done pretty quickly, but with some difficulty. Rotating the 'object' was the 
				difficult part. I considered using a matrix for this, but I could not find a way to get the relevant 
				information from the matrix and plot it. There may also be issues when getting close to stationary objects,
				as these parts may also be turned.
			</p>
			<p>
				My Solution to this was to have a different Object for each rotation of each object, although it is long, 
				at least there are only 4 versions and 7 objects. Validation is easier for this method, and the object should 
				not be able to go out of bounds.
			</p>
			<p>
				One thing this this option, is that objects cannot rotate near an edge. In normal Tetris, the object would
				move about so that is can rotate, but I couldn't be bothered to make it do that, so have fun with the game 
				being harder than normal.
			</p>
			<p>
				The next job was to get the objects to become part of the background. At first it was just full of errors,
				but eventually I got the code to apparently change the colours of the object. Which of course it is not meant to do.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the weekend of the 5th, I started to rearrange and re-name the website and its pages. This was because 
				there was a chance that it would be left for others to access in years to come, so I wanted to make it as
				organised as possible. All the 'useless' files, the notes and odd HTML documents that had been saved with 
				this site, were removed and every page that was to be kept was given sensible names (for quite some time, 
				the Dot Man files were named game2styles.css etc) and organised into separate folders together. This was 
				hoped to enable any future person looking through the files would be able to find what they were looking for.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also create the 'Expanding' page to provide notes on how to create more games and add them here.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the same weekend, I also finally found out how to insert an image as an icon in the tab. Turns out, 
				the image has to be a 'favicon.ico' file and its link must be placed just after the HTML tag at the beginning of the Document.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tetris became rather troublesome later that month. I managed to get the object to rotate correctly, 
				interact with blocks that are at the bottom of the game and be able to become part of the base. However, 
				only two of these would happen at any one time, and, once part of the base, the object would rarely come 
				back and when it did, it would not be complete.
			</p>
			<p>
				The bugs were fixed by re-ordering the way some of the functions are called, and creating new ones that do
				almost the same jobs as others. I now had a program that ran very well, but was incomplete. I then made a 
				function to delete the bottom row if it was full, and after a timer was added, this detected when any row was 
				full at any time.
			</p>
			<p>
				At this point, the end was in reach. The February Holidays has just started when I started to play about with
				the styling of the Tetris page. I also hopefully got the ending of Minesweeper to be detected correctly and 
				fixed a bug with Dot Man`s play button. (You could press play multiply times to make it faster). The High scores 
				for Dot Man, Tetris and Minesweeper was also added to the home page.
			</p>
			<img src="Z_Images/tetris.jpg" width="49%" style="float:right;padding:5px" alt="tetris Game play" onclick="r('Why do you keep clicking Images?')">
			<p>
				The <span onclick="r('Im in my final year of school')">final</span> step it would seem for Tetris was to make the game end once blocks were being placed at the top of 
				the screen. This actually took quite a while to get it working correctly, and enable the user to restart the 
				game by simply pressing Start again. Most of the time and error would occur as the game was trying to plot the
				object where it was not allowed to go. This error often caused the game to 'crash', and seemingly end.
			</p>
			<p>
				This was fixed though, by introducing a Boolean that stated whether the game was in play or not. Most key
				functions have been only able to go if the variable is true. The user also cannot press down if the game is 
				not in play, as this could cause issues if the game has finished, but the user can still press down.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the time of writing, Tetris does not show what blocks are coming up. This is because I never found it to
				be useful, and I cannot be bothered to create a different table to do so
			</p>
			<p>
				After the holidays, I found a way to get JavaScript to detect which browser you are using. As Edge is the 
				worst one, I have made my website deliberately able to disrupt Edge users. Sorry if you can only use edge,
				but links to where Chrome can be installed have been included.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, whilst testing Tetris, I found a bug that when you tried to turn when you would collide with another
				block, you died. I believe this issue has now been fixed, but it originates in an area that had several bugs
				during the creation of the game, so there may still be problems with it.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the end of this month, I started to move on to other stuff, such as revision, so I was ready to stop adding 
				stuff here. Although, I did start editing the actual website for later use. The expanding page was re-made and 
				turned into the Code description page, and more content was added there. The section below about my future Ideas 
				was also added in case any person comes along in the future and wants to add to it, or do stuff I never did.
			</p>
			<p>
				I found a way of being able to 'log in' using JavaScript. This would be used to allow a person with the relevant 
				log in details to alter the high scores via a user friendly interface. However, as mentioned below, this would 
				ideally be part of a server`s job for a few reasons such as the fact you can easily find unencrypted password and
				usernames in the code. <span onclick="r('<p style='font-size:11px'>
				My plan for a encrypt or decrypt function would be as follows<br>
				for encrypt, It would generate a random 2-chracter number (from 00 to 99) and then convert each character of the
				string to decrypt to ascii. Then for each character, add 1 then -1 then +2 then -2 then +3 then -3 then + 5 then -6 
				(if going out of the ascii range at all, set it to 0 or 256 etc),  finaly converting it all beck to text. 
				<br><br>
				To be continued...<br>Or maybe not. I don`t want you to know how to decrypt any of my messages!
				</p>')">In an ideal world, I would have created encrypt and decrypt functions and store a encrypted 
				version of the password, which is passed through the decrypt function every time it is needed. There would also be
				code to attempt to stop the console from using the decrypt function).</span>
			</p>

		<p style="display:block" onclick="r('Edge is BAD<br><br>The only good microsoft search engine is Bing, and only its maps. You can add in a OS map layer')">
			I also found a way to make this website less 'freindly' to Edge browser users. Sorry if you cannot use any other browser,
			But it is pretty funny and I am impressed that I found out how to use it. Bascially, Dot Man will not work as it keeps 	
			checking what browser you are using. If it is edge, then it stops, otherwise it continues as normal.
			The main website also produces a message saying 'Stop using edge' and gives a link to the places you can install google
			chrome.

			<h3>March 2022</h3>
			<p>
				During March 2022, I was still fixing bugs for a while, but revision for my final exams and second prelims started 
				to take over. Some stuff was added, such as the adverts, but nothing major was done.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the 14th, this site and its games become my STEM project. Before hand, it had just been a project that I started 
				in Applied Computing that had kind of got out of hand and had lots done to it in my free time.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the 22nd, This website had its first outing. It was shown to some of the older pupils of Callander primary. 
				The general feedback was positive. A few of them asked to have it on their Chromebooks, but I didn’t really want to 
				cause them to be missing/ignoring classes by playing these games. Minesweeper was a bit too complicated for them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Towards the end of this month, I also thought of a way to get this website online, but without a pHp Sever behind it. 
				Google Sites offers a free personal-use only website maker. But it is made for people to not have to use HTML code to 
				do so. I could however, copy some html code into a section. My thinking is to put my entire website into one document 
				and then copy the code into this section on google sites, and make it the full width of the page.
			</p>
			<p>
				For each Game, I need to do the following.
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Ensure not Function names clash</li>
					<li>Ensure no Class or Ids clash</li>
					<li>Ensure no variable names Collide</li>
					<li>Remember  to update the new names of things across all three documents</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				My method for this is to add the game name, then '_' in front of everything I need to change. If any of them do collide, 
				then there could be issues, such as incorrect score, the wrong function is called, and something completely different is done.
			</p>
			<p>
				This idea was a fail. Google sites would not let me use the full width of the sceren, so was always on small screen mode.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have also tried out using a place called tiiny.Host. Overall, I think it is what I wanted. But, due to sercurity reasons, it disliked any bits of code with
				windows.location in. Annoyingly, this included the refresh function which was used to reload the page. This led to the new way of setting up the game after each run.
			</p>
			<p>
				The most recent site used is gitHub, although it took me ages to get an account and be able to find anything. Most of it was led by Andrew Twigg again.
				 I also find it hard to update.
			</p>

		<h3>April 2022</h3>
		<p>
			Really, there should not be anything here, because I should have been revising. However, the basics of snake was made on the 
			afternoon of the 4th as I was procrastinating a lot, and ended up with most of the game after about 3 or 4 hours of work.
		</p>
		<p>
			The game itself is very simple. It has the basic plotting functions, the same as every other game. The movement is very 
			similar to Dotman, where the arrow keys change a direction variable and, on each tick, it will move in that direction.
		</p>
		<p>
			The only real tricky bit was getting the tail to exist and 'grow'. I used an array to solve this. When the player moves 
			to a new spot, it adds a new item to an array (at the bottom of it), plots the new position then unplot the first item 
			(index 0) of the array. Then all the containers are moved up 1, replacing index 0 with a new value.
		</p>
		<p>
			To extend the tail of the 'snake', I duplicate the second item in the array. This does cause the snake to not instantly 
			grow, but I like to think of it as the fruit going through the snake. Really, it was because I though this container may 
			get deleted / replaced when it should not be.
		</p>
		<p>
			There were also issues relating to resetting the game. Trying to set every table cell to blank proved much more difficult 
			that it should be.
		</p>
		<img src="Z_Images/snake.jpg" alt="Snake Game Play" width="49%" style="float:right;padding:5px"  onclick="r('Made in 6 hours')">		
		<p>
			The fruit also sometimes appeared on the tail of the snake, but this was fixed quickly.
		</p>
		<p>
			It really surprised me how quickly it took to make snake, or at least the simple version. In total, about 6 hours of work 
			went into the making of it before it was added to the website. A few bug fixes have since been added to it
		</p>
		<p>
			Whilst looking for a contact at St Andrews university to see why I was rejected from there, I came across a way to make the 
			standard email software be opened by clicking on a button or link in HTML. It is not what I wanted to do, but it is close 
			enough. This was then added as the feedback page (version 2). As I would technically be storing your data, such as Email 
			address, a made up a simple privacy policy using my knowledge form Cyber security.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also this month, I started working on two more games, which I intend to release for the STEM festival. These are my version 
			of Wordle and Space Shooter. At the time of writing, both are nowhere near completion, and I don`t know if they will even be 
			done. Chances are they will be under extreme testing during the festival.
		</p>
		<p>
			Space shooter is mentioned below in my Ideas page, but basically at this stage it is planned to be a fighter jet that you 
			can control shooting asteroids or perhaps aliens etc. What’s different about this games is that I have decided to play 
			about with the position property for positioning, rather than use table cells. this is mainly due to the fact that I could 
			not get a asteroid or fighter jet to display and move correctly with table  cells.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, the ammunition would also be interesting to code. Asteroids would be simple enough to code, but having a way to detect 
			when 'sprites' are being hit by each other would most certainly be hard
		</p>
		<p>
			Space shooter seems like something that would take an hour in scratch. It seems like I am constantly trying to make scratch 
			blocks in JavaScript, such as the 'move forward' block or 'if touching sprite' block / statement. I am attempting to make 
			use of several div tags as my version of sprites. each div is then given its own styling to make it look like what its meant 
			to be.

					Wordle, or at least my version of it, will be easier to code, probably. my plan for that is to have a 5 x 5 table, 
					where you can enter any letter (a to z) into it. A submit button will then turn each input box to either red (letter

					I`m now writing this after I have finished the first version of Wordle, and my only though it is:<b> Wow. </b>

			<h3>May 2022</h3>
			<p>
				For the beginning of May, I did not do anything, as I had exams and I actually did revision rather than this.
				<br>However, as my last exam was the 13<sup>th</sup>, I had nothing else better to do.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whilst attempting to make space shooter, I found a way to crash the JavaScript, but sadly not enough to close the chrome tab. 
				If you have a for loop, I was trying to find a way to make the increment in the for loop to be a decimal, so I used counter + increment.<br>
				It would not work, not even a red error in the console. The console just stopped working.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first asteriods were moving at 1100 on 18/05/2022. However, the two that did move were slow and did not show up again once they went out of bounds.
				<br>Simple getting them to move is quite a milestone, and there was tones of bugs to fix before the code actually started to work. One of them was that 
				I assumed a pre-defined function produced numbers in degrees rather than the radians it produced. This lead to further erros later, that would ultimatly 
				make the asteriods move nowhere.
			</p>
			<p>
				Later that day, the asteriods were all moving towards the player, as long as the player was on the right hand side of the screeen. They also all stoped early
				<br>
				One thing I really want to solve is how to remove the background of the images that I use for the asteroids and ship, then it would look much better. I did find 
				a website that would do it for you, but it only worked for a few times.<br>
				If anyone reading this is good at computer art and you are willing, please send me .jpg images of better asteroids. Please send to the listed email address.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				On the 21st, I began to work on the Ammunition, and getting it to fire. By the end of the day, I had them all working, although they do not affect the 
				asteroids in any way yet. As there are only 12 possible ammunitions, (As each amo is a div with the styling required for it, and there is only 12 of them),
				if you were to rapidly fire them all at once, you would use them all up. This is the reason why the game as a overheat-like aspect to it. Once all the divs 
				are in use, then the ship no longer fires anything.
			</p>
			<p>
				The 23<sup>rd</sup> was the first day of the STEM Activities. It was a medical based day, where people came in with medical equipment for people to use. 
				This was not my cup of tea, so I did not go. Instead, I stayed at home doing my SAAS application and adding Audio to my games.
				The first of which was Minesweeper. I added two sounds, A digging sound, for when the tiles are uncovered. And an explosion, for when you hit a mine.
				<br><i>Warning, it is a bit loud</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				Not-so-flappy Dot was given sound next. A sound for when it moves up and down, and a sound for when it dies.
			</p>
			<p>
				I mentioned it above, but the sounds used in the games are from <a href="https://www.zapsplat.com/">https://www.zapsplat.com/</a>. <br>
				Its in the Terms and Contitions that I have to states that the sounds are from them.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the 27<sup>th</sup>, I began to try and make final improvements to my Website in preparation for the STEM festival. 
				The first of which was to finaly give DotMan a better die message, rather than an alert box. It is now a HTML pop-up box.
				<br>
					The next day, I worked on Tetris, making it impossible for the same shape to show up more than three times in a row.
					 Although now it rarely does it 2 times in a row.			
				<br>
				<i>Only read this next section if you promise not to annoy others with it.</i>
				<button onclick="SA_dieButtons()">I agree not to annoy anyone playing these games, or tell anyone else who hasn`t agreed to the following,about the following section</button>
				<br><section style="display:none" id="agreeZone_01">
					<p>
						I also made the # key an automatic die button. If any of my main games are in play mode, # will make the user die instantly. <br>
						It was made for the festival, in case there was any one or two people always playing the games. They may say that they will go
						when they die, and I can cause that event.
					</p>
				</section>
				<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				I also finally finnished minesweeper. I got it possible for you to win, as there has been a continous error that prevented you from winning.
				There was a line or two of code that has been in existance form a ancient version of Minesweeper, and it had never been removed, which was causing all the issues.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before the STEM fesitval, I was working on Space Shooter. I added it into the game, just so that I can show what I had.
				However, It is not very good. I put a password on the game, so to veiw its page on the webiste, you need to know that it is. 
				<br><br>
				At the moment, the Amnumition fires, and the asteriods move. I found a way to stop all the chaotic movement and remove the need for a set coreection factor for
				the objects positions.
				<br>The first one was solved by using blank images. Rather than using the display = none property, which make the object have no effect on the page, the image allows ts shape to still be there.
				The next issue was solved by putting everything in its own div, withing the main play area. these divs are positioned at teh top left corner and this move relative to them. Also chainging the z-index
				of each item together makes this work
			</p>
			<p>
				The main reason that the game does not work is becauseit is too laggy, everything is moving too slowly. The collision functions also do not work well / most of the time.
				The asteriods also appear to to move in the dead state (explosion), even though there is code that should not allow them to move unless they are in asteriod form. 	
			</p>
			<p>
				I also tried to add adverts into my main website, but came across a flaw of having everything in the same webpage.<br>
				The is a limit to how much CSS can be in a webpage. I found this once before when making a pHp based site. Whilste making the adverts, 
				I came across this limit for this page. After a google search, I think the limit is about 31 pages of CSS, or just over 4000 rules.
				But as I import a styles sheet for a few symbols, then I would not know how big I can go. I got to about 700 lines before the error occured.
				<br>Chances are, I will either stop expanding this page, or try to seperate it into differnet files.

			<h3>June 2022</h3>
			<p>
				A month ago I would have though I would have stopped making this Website. However, I have not it seems. 
				At the begining of this month, I made a new Game.
			</p>
			<p>
				I made Tron on the 6<sup>th</sup>, within 2 or 3 hours. (I started after Lunch and would finish it before 4).
				It was mainly for there to be a two-player game and is basically a cross between Dotman and snake, so it was very easy to make.
			</p>
			<p>
				I did find a possible way to remove the cell borders in the tables, which I think I will apply to all my other games. 
				The only difficult part of this game was, it seems, was getting the checks to see if you should die in the correct order.
				As I did them all in one line, the checking boundaries must be first to ensure that the next part, checking the record for
				what it is at, is correct. Otherwise there is an error.
			</p>
		</section>
		<br>
		<p>
			As I am going to univeristy in Spetember (2022), I am likly to stop doing this Website, at least for now, as the programing languages that Glasgow
			use in first year are Python and Java. Both of which I have a basic understanding of, but I want to be reasonably good at them when I go off to 
			university. Java, as the name suggests is very similar to Javascript, but is used more for server-side / back-end programing whilste Javascript is
			for client-side. (webpages etc. The stuff you seee when veiwing the material)
		</p>
		<p>
			A version 6 of this site may be made, using pHp. I have finally, after 5 months of trying, got XAMMP working on my computing. <i>XAMMP is the software I use to run pHp.</i>
			However, It may not be for a while.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is because I have started something else. When I was applying to university, they all gave me a application tracker of thier own. Edinburgh`s site was ok, but it looked old. 
			St Andrews, I can`t remeber becuase I forgot my password and was rejected. But I think it was quite good. <br>
			Glasgow`s, on the other hand. I though it was auwful. It was hard to navigate, styling was off, and I rarely found what I was looking for.<br>
			So I though, once I got pHp working, to try and make my own Application tracker site, with a side for (prosporus) students to veiw thier own application and view other information. 
			And there would be a side for staff to view every application, and make desicisons about them. Eg, reject or give them an offer.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is mainly so that I can say to myself, I can make a better site than the univeristy, in my opinion.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have not listed everything that I have added in this website in this description of it.<br><span onclick="r('Such as this...')">
			Explore the website to find them all...</span><br>

		<section id="future">
			<p>
				In case anyone wants to try and make thier own games, in these files, in the Z_other folder, there is a rough template. It is unlikly to be helpful, but its there.
			</p>
		
		
			<h3>Ideas</h3>
			<p>
				I do not know if I will be able to expand this website in the future, as they are 
				mainly just a collection of files at the time of writing, and particularly as I have
				now left school, I will be unable to update any version at school. The following 
				section is a list of Ideas for my website that I have not done yet, or at least 
				is not present in this current version). Feel free to try and do some of these 
				yourself, if you can.
			</p>
			<p>
				One thing that you could guess is that I want to make more games and add them here. 
				I`m thinking a tower defence like game, as I have always liked them. Most likely
				using the position property and end up similar to my space shooter game, but with 
				more objects. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A driving game would also be good, again with the position property, as you won’t 
				be driving in straight lines. I think a few 2-player games would be good to 
				included, a driving game would be an obvious one to make 2-player. Space shooter 
				was originally meant to be two-player, but it was hard enough to make single 
				player. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One game that I would want to make, that would be 2-player, would be Connect 4. 
				If you have ever played me, then you would know that I am very good at connect 
				four, and I have always wanted to make a computer connect 4 game that I find 
				difficult to beat. Of course, there would be a two-player mode as well. This could 
				be done in the table mode. Red background, style the ‘coins’ blue and yellow with
				a large border radius to make them look circular… I think that could be possible. 
				Maybe not the nice animated drop of it. I want to make a 3D game as well, but 
				getting it to display would be very, very hard. Hence, I have not tried. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The biggest Idea that I would like to do to my website would make it connected to 
				a server, ideally pHp. This way, I could (if its on the internet) update the website
				remotely and it would forever be accessible. High scores would not be the high
				score for your machine that you are using, but the actual high score from across 
				the world. I would also have to then find a way to remove the cheats way of getting
				good scores….
			</p>
			<p>
				I would also like to play about with an email server, and could include this 
				in the site, so that it sends me emails when you fill out a form. I was very 
				close to doing this with pHp, until the error said it wanted an email server. 
				I have included a link to a google form, and a possible email address for 
				feedback to be sent to instead, but it’s not the same.

				Servers could come with the possibility for file handling, so I think I could 
				‘upload’ a new game and it would automatically appear. One of the reasons this 
				website is in existence is to expand not-so-flappy Dot. Instead of me making 
				hundreds of random sections for the game, users could make their own, upload it 
				to the server where I could check if they were reasonable, or make a program to 
				do it for me. Then, the not-so-flappy dot game would get its random sections from 
				the server and run them. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Whilst I was adding audio, which used to be in this ideas section, I was using 
				Audacity which seemed familiar. I figured that it was the same bit of software 
				that we used in S4 computing when we were playing with sounds. This website also
				makes an obvious use of HTML and CSS, but there is quite a few Software development
				aspects to it as well. If there was a database connected via a server, then this 
				website would be a nice collection of work that represents what I`ve done in 
				computing over the years. OK, there’s not much about binary or environmental
				applications of computers, but they’re only small parts. With the Privacy policy,
				there`s my Cyber security aspect.
			</p>
			<p>
				If I try to make a 3D game, I think sticking to the classics would be a good idea, an then I could attempt to make cubert.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, I would like to improve what I have, such as finish wack-a-character or 
				make Dot/Pac Man have their moving mouth. Tetris normally have a way to see what’s
				coming up, and I never seem to get the finishing point of Minesweeper to be right. 
				
			</p>

		<br><br>
		<p>
			I want to continue making this website, adding new things, making bits work again and trying things I think I can do.
			<br>
			Ultimately, that’s what this website it.

			<h3>Structure of my Games</h3>
			<p>
				Each of my games are made up in a similar way, with there being bits of code that are at different levels.<br>
				There are the lowest level functions, these being the plotting functions - the ones that alter the HTML play area.
				The next level up is the functions that are able to control the previous functions. They often are the ones that 
				set the entire playing area to a default value or movement functions that unplot an object, do something with its values,
				then re-place it at a new position. These middle level functions basically each have a job to do that is part of the game, 
				but do not run the entire game<br>
				The top-level functions are the ones that either make it a game, add additional  features or take user input. They would 
				control the timings or update the display with the new score.

		<section id="randomSections">
			<h3>Random Sections</h3>
			<p>
				For Not-so-Flappy Dot, there are a series of random sections after 200 or so columns. These can be added to 
				with some ease. Ideally, when you make a section, it would be uploaded to a server and then the game takes the
				sections from the server. But at the current moment it does not do so. Therefore, you have to make the section
				using one of my extra programs. It can be found in the external links section. Create your section here, 
				entering your name if you wish.
			</p>
			<p>
				Open up the file for the not-so-flappy Dot code in a suitable JavaScript editor. Scroll down to find a
				function called <kbd>update_X_20()</kbd>. Note the very long compact if statement. Find the bottom 
				one and the number in it, for <kbd>	}else if (R_20 == 119){update_20_for_R119();</kbd> the number would be
				119. Duplicate this line and change the number in it by 1 Back in the Random section maker, in the number input, enter the number mentioned about <b> + 1</b>.
				Then press Click to produce code.
			</p>
			<p>
				It will give you the option to download a text file with the code in it. You can say yes, but either  way you
				need to copy the code it makes from either the text file or the input box that appears after.
				paste this code. ideally, above the <kbd>NoRandoms</kbd> variable  but below the rest of the random
				sections. The variable would also have to be the same number that you entered into the form
				<br><br>This should now be working and your section is in the game
			</p>
			<p>
				If, for some reason, it does not work, here is a list of possible reason to why it is not working;
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Are you editing the same file you are loading?</li>
				<li>Have you done everything on the list?</li>
				<li>The else if line may be too great. You may have to find the largest function number</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Dot Man</h3>
				<p>
					Creating Dot Man took a while. It started off as a HTML table that was 30 cells tall and 60 cells wide. This was made before I
					had a program that made the HTML code for me, so it took a while to insert each Id for each table cell.
					<br><br>
					The next 'layer' up was to create some plot and unplot functions. These functions change the class on a specified table cell
					which allows it to change colour and, in some cases, shape. 
					<br><br>
					The map is stored in an array of arrays (a dictionary) that contains a single number (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3) 
					where each number specifies a class the cell should be. 0 is empty, 1 is for walls, 2 is coins, 3 is for power up.
					The ghosts and players are not one of these numbers.
					<br><br>
					The next major function to be created was the 'loadString()'. This one takes the Dictionary that contains 
					the map and loads it onto the table. It loops through the record and looks to see what number is in the container.
					It then calls the appropriate plot function and passes though the X and Y of the table cell. 		
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The player is controlled by the arrow keys or WASD. When you click any key, a function, whichButton(), is called. 
					It determines which button was pressed.
					Most buttons do not do anything, and those that do often require admin privileges. ie. they were only for 
					testing. 
					<br><br>
					The few that are available are to move the player. The arrow keys alter a variable, playerDirection, to the direction pressed.
					The move player function takes the direction and moves player that direction each time it is run, assuming it is not blocked
					<br>
					After these functions, the movePayer function then calls two more functions collision() and tp().
					<br  onclick="r('That was a line break')"><br>
					Collision() checks to see if the player is colliding with anything, such as ghosts or coins. 
					It uses the same string that loaded the map to see if there are any coins or power ups at their location.		
					<br>If any of the ghost`s X and Y coordinates match, they are colliding with the player.
					<br>If colliding with ghosts, and player does not have power up on, then he players lives are reduced by 1.
					if no lives left, end the game.
					<br>If the player does have power up on, eat the ghost.
					<br><br>
					When colliding with either coins or power up, the map location is set to 0 (empty) and the coin is removed.
					If it was a coin, the score is increased by 1. if it was a power up, a boolean variable determining if power up is on is set to true
					and a time out is set up to turn the power up effect off after a set time				
					<br><br>
					The tp() function looks to see if the player should be teleporting. if so, unplot thier position and re-plot 
					them at the other side of the play area.
					<br>
					
				</p>
				<p>
					When the play button is pressed, the stage, score and lives are set to their starting values, the map is loaded and 
					the two timers are set off. These are Pticker() and Gticker(). 
					<br><br>
					Pticker() sets of the player function, if game play is allowed. 
					It the sets off a time out to call itself again later. it also calls updateDisplay(), which ensues that the display that the player sees 
					(about lives and score etc) is correct.
					<br><br>
					Gticker() calls the ghosts running functions similar to how the Pticker() calls the player running function.
					However, it does  check to see if the ghosts should be running away from the player or moving towards them.
					It should also have the capability to cause them to all move randomly if the player does not exist, for whatever reason
				</p>

			<section id="ghostCode">		

				<h3>The Ghosts code</h3>
				
				<p>
					The Ghosts all have very similar code, so all start off the same. Here they set the local 
					variables that are used frequently. These are variables to store the difference in the X value (dx),
					difference in Y values (dy), the ghosts current X and Y Position, Gx and Gy - 
					both of these are already set and stored, but their variable is long,  so I simplified it.
					The Ghosts current direction and the players X Y are also included	
				</p>
				<p>
					There is also another variable which is used to figure out if the code worked and stops some errors later
				</p>
				<p>
					The first if's are mostly irrelevant. One 'kills' the ghost if they are in an invalid position - which should not occur.
					The Second one is to encourage the ghost to go through the teleproter if it would be shorter, but only works on one map
				</p>
				
				<p>
					After this, it goes into one main if statement, with several sub-ifs.
					The very first bit tests to see if the ghost and the player are at the same position, if so, go wherever the ghost is going
				</p>
				<p>
					The next part happens if the ghost thinks it is a corner, which is done by running a separate  function to determine the amount of free spaces around the ghost. 
					If it returns 2, then it must be a corner or a straight line. another function determines if it is a straight line or corner.<br>
					For a corner, it finds which one is free, where it did not come from and goes that way.
					<br>For a straight line, continue in the direction the ghost was going
				</p>
				<p>
					The next bit determines if it is a dead end or junction
					for a dead end, it turns around.
					The methods for junctions are different for each ghost, but the general idea is 
					presented below
				</p>

				<p>
					When a ghost reaches a junction, tests to see if the player and it are in  straight line and tries to head directly for them.
					if it encounters and obstacle, the ghost will choose a random direction around the wall.
					<br>
					Otherwise, the ghost will calculate the gradient between the player and the ghost.
					the players X and Y and this gradient are used to determine which quadrant the player is in.
					<br><br><i>For the next part, the gradient is assumed to be positive for the purposes of explaining, but it can be negative</i>
					<br><br>If the gradient is less than 1 (but greater than 0), the red ghost would try to travel along the X axis. If it cannot, 
					it would travel along the Y axis, both towards the player. 			
				</p>
				<p>
					When each direction is made, the program alters dx or dy by one or -1, so when the code comes to the end,
					it will unplot the current ghost position then see if it should teleport, if so it does so,
					it then changes the ghost x and y position by dx and dy <b>and</b> change the ghosts official direction.
					It then re-plots the ghost at its new position.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					If the player has eaten a power up, the ghosts use the same methods of going towards the player, but if it decides to go left, 
					it would try and go right. 
					
					
				</p>
				<p>
					The final step of the ghosts code is to place the ghost in its new position. This is done by unplotting the current ghost position
					then using the enemy plot function to plot the ghosts in their new position. However, there are a few if`s between the steps to 
					allow the ghost to teleport - if the ghosts X is less then the page, go to the other side. there is also code to stop some errors from
					occurring. sometimes the ghost decides to go onto a wall. This is stopped here and sends the ghost back to the start.

			<h3>Dotman Code</h3>
			<p>
				To start, I Knew that I had to create a HTML table that originally filled the entire page. 
				To do it manually would take too long, so I made another javascript program that does it for me. 
				I can input the height and width of the table, along with a class name for each table cell, and a 
				function for what to do on a right or left click of the mouse. The program then runs a For loop in 
				a For loop and outputs the html code into a text box, which can be copied. I also found a way for it 
				to be downloaded. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Once the HTML and CSS was made, I moved on to making the Javascript. Firstly, It was the plotting function, 
				the functions that receive a  coordinate point on the table to change to their colour. As each table cell has 
				a unique ID in the form ‘btnY_X’, I can use the x and y points given to create the ID of the table cell to change. 
				I then remove every CSS class from the given cell and replace it with the one that I want to use. There are a total 
				of 8 of these plotting functions. The benefits of using the classList.add and .remove is that I can alter more than 
				just its colour the Circular Dotman and ghosts is done by setting the border radius to half of its height/width.
				<br>I then also create the function whichButton(). This is activated when a keyboard key is pressed and takes the value 
				of the key pressed through a Large If statement to see what the program should do. This is how the arrow  keys / WASD work, as the player's direction is altered. This function is also useful for testing certain aspect of the program. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The next step was to be able to save the entire background that the game has. 
				This is done in a record (array of arrays) and a number representing what is there is stored in the record. 
				0 is empty, 1 is a wall. The record itself is stored outside the functions so that is is a global record, 
				being accessed by every function. A function that then goes through this large record and calls the relevant 
				plotting function was also created.
			</p>
			<p>
				After that, I started working on the player, which required the use of a few more global variables, 
				the players X and Y coordinates and the  players direction, as pac man would not stop until you change
				direction. the function that moves the player, movePlayer() starts by unplotting the current player 
				position, using one of the plotting functions mentioned above. Then it goes through a if statement
				which basically looks to see which direction the player is going and if it would still be within the 
				boundaries of the game. It then also runs a test with the function testPosition() of where the player
				would be if the statement was to return true. if all the statements are true, then the pliers X and Y 
				values will change. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The function testPosition() is used a lot later, but it is used to determine if the given coordinates 
				are a wall or if it is a passable place. It looks at the containers in the record that stores what the 
				background of the game is to see if it has the value of 1. if it does it returns false, meaning that a 
				character cannot exist there. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The function collision() is also called whilst moving the player and it looks to see if the player is 
				colliding with a ghost, if it is, then the player dies by calling the DIE() function. Unless of course 
				the boolean variable that states whether the player has the power up effect on is active, then the player's 
				score increases by 50, and the ghost that got eaten is sent back to the start.
				<br>Collision() also detects whether or not the player is touching a coin, if so increasing the score by 1 
				at altering the record for where the coin is to be 0, empty. If the player is not touching a coin, then it 
				might be touching a power up. If so, then the boolean variable that states if the power up is not or not is 
				set to true and a timer is called to turn the variable back to false after a certain amount of time. This is 
				the reason that the power ups cannot be stacked. the function that returns it to false cannot be altered once 
				it has started.
			</p>
			<p>
				After collision(), the movePLayer() function calls tp(), teleport. this is for when the player is at the edge 
				of the screen, it sends it to the other side. It merely changes the players X and or Y coordinates, as the player 
				is still not showing since the unplot() function was called at the beginning. The player comes back on the next 
				and final line, which re-plots the player at the players X and Y coordinates, which may have altered during 
				the course of the function running. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The ghosts properties, such as coordinates, direction and colour are saved in a record, with each category of 
				the record is the ghost, and the array within that part is that ghost's properties. Whenever this record is
				used, its length is never really in the code, meaning that I can easily add more ghosts, or reduce the number 
				of ghosts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Each of the functions that moves the ghosts are very similar, but each is slightly different. The code for 
				the orange one, the first to move, is mostly random, hence it will not usually follow you. However, if you 
				get within 6 or so tabl cells and are directly in a straight line towards you, it will follow you. This is 
				where there are some bugs relating to the orange one being capable of going through walls. For the following 
				bit, M  = gradient between the ghost and the player. The red one takes the shortest route towards you. if in 
				a straight line, M = 0 or M = undefined, the ghost will move towards you directly, unless it is at a junction 
				where it cannot go in your direction, then it will pick a random direction perpendicular to you. If the gradient 
				is between -1 and 1, I will move towards you along the X axis. If the gradient is less than -1 or greater 
				than 1, then it will move along the Y axis. This is assuming that is is able to do so. If it is at a corner 
				or a straight line, then it will continue ‘forward’. A dead end is treated like a junction, except it can only 
				go in one direction.
				<br>The pink ghost is very similar to the red ghost, except at junctions. Where the option is available, the 
				pink ghost favours going along the Y axis rather than the X axis when the gradient is between -1 and 1, and 
				favours the X axis when the red would go along the Y. These two then create an aspect of the ghosts being
				able to cut you off. The blue ghost however, is a combination of the red and pink ghost. Each time its functions
				run, it picks  (at random) which function to use - the one for red or the one for pink. This is handy as there 
				where / are areas of the game where the red and pink ghosts would end up getting stuck and going in loops should 
				you stay still. The blue ghosts may take a while, but will get to you eventually, ensuring you can't keep going forever.
			</p>
			<p>
				The ghosts, particularly the oregon one, makes use of several functions that support the decision making process. 
				They mostly just see if the ghosts can exist at a certain position, or return a list of directions that the ghosts
				is allowed to go. One of them is IsCorner(), and it returns the number of positions that the ghost could go. if it 
				is 2, then the ghosts will look further to see if it is a corner or straight line. if it is 1, then it will move
				backwards as it must be dead end. 3 or 4 are junctions and makes the above decisions to decide which way to go.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you click the play button, it runs a function that is only executed at the beginning of the game, 
				and it ensures that the game is not already running. (There were glitches for some time that if you 
				clicked the play button too many times, the ghosts would end up going faster.)  The main purpose of this 
				start function is to set the default values to the global variables and then start two functions which 
				once they are finished, set a timer to recall themselves. these two are the functions that run the player 
				and the ghosts. When, for example, the player function runs, it calls the move player function. (The move
				player function does not call itself because it's easier to control. It also means that I can call that 
				function more often without sleeping the game up.) Move player also then calls the function that updates
				the display, which ensures that the score is up to date. 
				<br>When it calls itself, it can only do so if the boolean value that shows weather or not the game is still
				active is true. Once this value is set to false, the game will end as the functions that keep the game going 
				will end and not restart. This means that you do not have to refresh the page to stop the timers, unlike some
				of my other games.

			<h3>Creating your own game</h3>
			
			<p>
				To start off with, I will tell you the main structure of how my games run.<br>
				They are all just a HTML table, with each square table cell having a different background colour and a unique ID. 
				Often the ID is in the form of "btnX_Y", to make it easier to know which one I am trying to change.
				Then, I have code that would turn a particular table cell to a differnet colour.
				<br>
				You may be thinking that it must have taken a very long time to make these tables, which it did for the first 2 or 3 times,
				but then I made a program that create a table for me. I could enter the Height and Width of it, enter the function name when 
				you click (or right clicked) the table cell, if necessary. A class name would also be added to each table cell along with its ID.
			</p>
			
			<p>Click <a href="">here</a> to acess it</p>
	
			<p>
				I put a lot of effort into making these games, but over 
				time, they became easier to make. Not only was I more 
				familiar with JavaScript, but I knew which bits of code
				from previous games to copy over into my new one. As I 
				have said elsewhere, Andrew Twigg helped me reduce my 
				code down considerably for Not-So-Flappy Dot. This was 
				because he reduced the function that plotted each point 
				down to about 10 lines of code, no matter how big the 
				table is. It removes a list of classes from the table 
				cell, then adds a new one.
				<br>If in your CSS file, you have all the necessary 
				classes, add them in the list next to the 
				<i>.classList.remove</i>(, in "". Then, add the class you want
				to add in the last row, at <i>.add.</i>
				<br>Below is the unplot function from Not-so-Flappy Dot.
				The dots can have the classes of player, empty, enemy,
				powerUp, lazer or slime but in this example, the dot 
				will have the class of empty.
			
			</p>
			
			<p class="codeClip"><i>
				function unplot(x, y) {<br>
				document<br>
					.querySelector(`.Row${y}`)<br>
					.querySelectorAll(".dot")<br>
					[x - 1].classList.remove("player", "empty","enemy","powerUp","lazer","slime");<br>
				document<br>
					.querySelector(`.Row${y}`)<br>
					.querySelectorAll(".dot")<br>
					[x - 1].classList.add("empty");<br>
				}
			</i></p>
			
			<p>
				Or alternatively, use;
				<br><i class="codeClip">document.getElementById(id).classList.add("coin");</i>
				<br> OR
				<br><i class="codeClip">document.getElementById(id).classList.add("power");</i><br>
				<br>Where id is the id of the table cell you are trying to change.
				<br>I would recommend  this one.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				If you are making another game for this website, I would assume that the JavaScript, HTML and CSS files are all in one folder
				this folder would be placed in the same folder as the other games, which should be the first one
			</p>
			<p>
				To add our game to the same website, if you wish to do so, Open up this page (Website_Home.html) in a suitable  editor
				and go to the div with the ID 'PLAY'. This is the section that appears as the play page.<br>
				Firstly, you would have to add an additional 'a' tag, with and appropriate function to hide all the other games.<br>
				As you scroll down, you should see divs with Ids of game names. At the bottom of this list is a empty div. Copy this one and fill it
				out with the relevant information.<br><br>
				Now try reloading the page and see if it has been added.

			</p>
			<p>
				On the actual shop page, I really wanted to improve this bit. The page would show, say, 3 per row on a full page.
				However, as you decrease the page width, Ideally, it would show less per row, such as 2 or 1. The navigational bar
				could also do with some improvment when the window width is not full. <br> The Shop page would also Ideally load 
				a box for each and every item in the database. When I left it, it could only show a set number (12) items.
			</p>
			<p>
				On W3 school, after I made this site, I found a way to create a filter box. You could start entering a name and 
				it would hide all thoughs that do not match. This I think could be used to search through the shop`s items, especially 
				when it gets big. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_filter_table.asp">Click here to go to it</a>

			<h3>Project concept</h3>
			<p><i>See the <span onclick="about()">About Us</span> page for more detail</i></p>
			
			<p>
				This idea was first started in June 2021, when I was experimenting with Microbits and made a very basic game on them. It was a dodging game, similar to not-so-flappy Dot. 
				I started to expand it, but was unable to due to the file size limit on the Microbits. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I came back to it after the October holidays and tried to make the same game on a website. it took some time to get started - changing the colour of a particular table cell
				proved more difficult than I expected. I have a bad habit with my programming in that I do not stop adding stuff to it, which often leads to there being aspects that are 
				useless, or not needed. Not-so-flappy Dot did get that. There are many things in it that are not required to work. Probably the best addition was the addition of Highscores. 
				This then needed a way of displaying the highscores, so an additional website was made. This site then evolved to become the main site today.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the other games, I started making them because I wanted to improve my own programming skills. Tetris was for moving a collection of dots together. Minesweeper has the 
				only use of a function that could call itself that I could think of. Dotman had the ghosts, which were meant to be kind of smart to move towards you.
			</p>
			<p>
				I’m interested in this project because it is programming, but I can display it in a nice way with HTML and CSS. Compared to many of the other programming languages that are
				used in the real world, JavaScript was accessible for me and had a nice way of outputting what it is doing. Python may have been able to do this, but it was harder to get started. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The games are more about me trying to think around major programming aspects. Minesweeper makes use of recurring function (functions that call themselves), Tetris is about 
				objects moving together (an object exists in more than one table cell, a concept I had not tried before now), and Dot Man (Pac Man) has Ghosts / NPCs / the computer has to 
				think to go towards you. Not-so-flappy-Dot was more about the idea of getting a JavaScript game to work.
			</p>
		</section>
		
		<br><br>
		
		<section id="stem_process">
			<h3>Project process</h3>
			<p>
				When it says ‘finish the game’ or make it a game, it includes adding a way to finish the game (ie You win message), a way to lose the game (i.e. you died), a way to 
				start the game (a start button usually). Often also includes scores or lives, timer to make the game move forward.
			</p>
			<p>
				There was not really a ‘plan’ as such to the project. It started off as way to expand a Microbit project and new parts were added when I though of them
			</p>
			<p>
				Create Game 1 (not-so-flappy Dot) 
				<ul>
					<li>create table with ids for every cell</li>
					<li>create function that will change the specified ID to a different colour</li>
					<li>get Cells to change on a timer, then in a nice order</li>
					<li>create player</li>
					<li>put it all together and add final functions to make it a game</li>
				</ul>
				Create Website
				<ul>
					<li>Nav bars</li>
					<li>Title / header</li>
					<li>Highscores page</li>
					<li>About us page - contains the history / diary of website</li>
					<li>log in aspect.</li>
				</ul>
				Create Dot man
				<ul>
					<li>get Table and player working (similar to steps for not-so-flappy Dot)</li>
					<li>get NPCs working</li>
					<li>put all together</li>
				</ul>
				Create Minesweeper
				<ul>
					<li>get the cascading uncover function working</li>
					<li>get the numberings working</li>
					<li>get the hiding mines function to be working</li>
					<li>finish the game</li>
				</ul>
				Create Tetris
				<ul>
					<li>Get the objects to move as one</li>
					<li>get the objects to rotate</li>
					<li>move them down each time</li>
					<li>get them to stop on the boundaries (important - could cause error if it is trying to plot an id that does not exists) and other places blocks</li>
					<li>make it a game</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				The website however, is constantly under development. The highscores, Adjustable nav bar and feedback aspect were all added later on.

			<h3>21st Century Employability & Future Skills</h3>
			<p>
				Throughout this project, I developed several skills, although I had them already, they got better. One of these my ICT skills, as it was an ICT project. 
				Logical thinking was also critical, and most likely one of the most improved ones as I had to think what the code would do in a logical manner. Adaptability 
				was also improved because although I have had previous programming skills with Visual Basic, Scratch and Python, I have not had much experience with JavaScript. 
				Although I may have covered some of it in S4, it was not until the end of S5 that I started to understand it and this project required me to learn more. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In terms of self-motivation, resilience and perseverance, I found this to be quite easy. I became quite enthusiastic with this project and would happily 
				spend time on it, to the point that I was not doing the revision I should when I was expanding this project. This also lead to me having to develop my time 
				management skills in order to allow me to do some revision each day.
			</p>
			<p>
				On Christmas eve I was out walking the dog when I came up with the first solution for the ghost`s code for Dotman, and I spent time that day and the next 
				trying to get it to work. By New Year’s Day, the orange ghost ‘born’, and the others were made in early 2022. Often when there is an error that I cannot seem to fix,
				I leave it and go do something else for a bit which may be another aspect of the project. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There was not very much team work or communication skills involved, as most of my peers and teachers had very little knowledge of JavaScript. Andrew Twigg has helped me
				with a bit of code that reduced the amount of code that I have by a very large amount. He also has found a way for the project to be online.
			</p>
			<p>
				For my problem-solving skills, there were several problems that I have had to find ways round. Sometimes they are big problems, like how to make a major aspect of the 
				game (such as Tetris’s rotating blocks and moving the dots together) or it could be something small, like a syntax error. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One issue that had been persistent was in Dotman, the orange ghost often would go straight into the walls. this would cause the game to crash originally. I could not 
				find the error and put additional code in the ghost, which enabled the game to continue but a hole would appear where the ghost was. Only fairly recently did I find the 
				error. Turns out I was allowing the ghost to move without checking if there was a wall there. This bit was only for a few scenarios, which rarely came up.
			</p>
			<p>
				Originally, the ‘timers’ or the way to keep things moving was done by using the setInterval() function. This worked, but to stop them I had to refresh the page, which
				was OK until I tried to put everything in the same document and you would keep going back to the home screen. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For minesweeper, I experimented with setTimeOut(). This would call the function once after a period of time, rather than repeatable forever. Minesweeper made use of 
				this, defining it in a variable and clearing the timer when it is to stop. After this, I went to my other games and found a different way to get around it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There is a function, that when called, will run each aspect of the games to make them run. Once it has run one ‘tick’ of the game, it will call itself via a setTimeOut()
				function. This line however, is within an If statement that checks to see if the Boolean value for storing if the game is still playing is true. If true, wait a period then
				run again. If false, the function will reach its end and nothing else will start after it, ending the timer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Initiative and organisational skills were also improved. This was a mostly independent project and I had to make all the decisions about it. However, for the design layout, I asked other people what they thought of it. Organisational skills were also improved because this is a very large project with around 23 thousand lines of code, I had to be organised. The project is divided up into the games and the main website each having a folder of their own (however, for convenience, the HTML page for the website is not in the folders). In each folder is a HTML file, a CSS file and a JavaScript file. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The CSS file is for the styling of the HTML page, and I will be honest and say that none of them are particularly organised. But I think I get away with it as they are all relatively small. The JavaScript files are for the code. Often functions that work together, such as ones for the player or the plotting functions are found together, which is me moving them about to organise them. Realistically, I made these function together and they naturally appeared near each other.
			</p>
			<p>
				For my communication and literacy skills, this is most likely the largest part of the project that Involves them, unless you count what’s in the About Us page and the instructions. Finally, my research skills were also improved as I often ‘researched’ how each of the games were meant to work. (Most of the time I had to play them) Looking through W3 Schools for the pre-defined functions that I needed was also research.

		<h3>Dotman creation</h3>
			<p>
				The creation of Dotman is an example of my logical thinking, problem solving and to some extent my numeracy skills.
			</p>
			<p>
				To start, I Knew that I had to create a HTML table that originally filled the entire page. To do it manually would take too long, so I made 
				another JavaScript program that does it for me. I can input the height and width of the table, along with a class name for each table cell,
				and a function for what to do on a right or left click of the mouse. The program then runs a For loop in a For loop and outputs the html code 
				into a text box, which can be copied. I also found a way for it to be downloaded. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Once the HTML and CSS was made, I moved on to making the JavaScript. Firstly, It was the plotting function, the functions that receive a 
				coordinate point on the table to change to their colour. As each table cell has a unique ID in the form ‘btnY_X’, I can use the x and y points 
				given to create the ID of the table cell to change. I then remove every CSS class from the given cell and replace it with the one that I want 
				to use. There is a total of 8 of these plotting functions. The benefits of using the classList.add and .remove is that I can alter more than
				just its colour the Circular Dotman and ghosts is done by setting the border radius to half of its height/width.
			</p>
			<p>
				I then also create the function whichButton(). This is activated when a keyboard key is pressed and takes the value of the key pressed through a
				Large If statement to see what the program should do. This is how the arrow keys / WASD work, as the player's direction is altered. This function
				is also useful for testing certain aspect of the program. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The next step was to be able to save the entire background that the game has. This is done in a record (array of arrays) and a number representing
				what is there is stored in the record. 0 is empty, 1 is a wall. The record itself is stored outside the functions so that is is a global record,
				being accessed by every function. A function that then goes through this large record and calls the relevant plotting function was also created.
			</p>
			<p>
				After that, I started working on the player, which required the use of a few more global variables, the players X and Y coordinates and the players
				direction, as pac man would not stop until you change direction. the function that moves the player, movePlayer() starts by unpotting the current 
				player position, using one of the plotting functions mentioned above. Then it goes through a if statement which basically looks to see which 
				direction the player is going and if it would still be within the boundaries of the game. It then also runs a test with the function testPosition() 
				of where the player would be if the statement was to return true. if all the statements are true, then the pliers X and Y values will change. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The function testPosition() is used a lot later, but it is used to determine if the given coordinates are a wall or if it is a passable place. 
				It looks at the containers in the record that stores what the background of the game is to see if it has the value of 1. if it does it returns 
				false, meaning that a character cannot exist there. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The function collision() is also called whilst moving the player and it looks to see if the player is colliding with a ghost, if it is, then the 
				player dies by calling the DIE() function. Unless of course the Boolean variable that states whether the player has the power up effect on is 
				active, then the player's score increases by 50, and the ghost that got eaten is sent back to the start.
			</p>

			<p>
				Collision() also detects whether or not the player is touching a coin, if so increasing the score by 1 at altering the record for where the coin is 
				to be 0, empty. If the player is not touching a coin, then it might be touching a power up. If so, then the Boolean variable that states if the power 
				up is not or not is set to true and a timer is called to turn the variable back to false after a certain amount of time. This is the reason that the 
				power ups cannot be stacked. the function that returns it to false cannot be altered once it has started.
			</p>
			<p>
				After collision(), the movePLayer() function calls tp(), teleport. this is for when the player is at the edge of the screen, it sends it to the 
				other side. It merely changes the players X and or Y coordinates, as the player is still not showing since the unplot() function was called at 
				the beginning. The player comes back on the next and final line, which re-plots the player at the players X and Y coordinates, which may have 
				altered during the course of the function running. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The ghosts’ properties, such as coordinates, direction and colour are saved in a record, with each category of the record is the ghost, and 
				the array within that part is that ghost's properties. Whenever this record is used, its length is never really in the code, meaning that I
				can easily add more ghosts, or reduce the number of ghosts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Each of the functions that moves the ghosts are very similar, but each is slightly different. The code for the orange one, the first to move, 
				is mostly random, hence it will not usually follow you. However, if you get within 6 or so table cells and are directly in a straight line 
				towards you, it will follow you. This is where there are some bugs relating to the orange one being capable of going through walls. For the 
				following bit, M  = gradient between the ghost and the player. The red one takes the shortest route towards you. if in a straight line, M = 0
				or M = undefined, the ghost will move towards you directly, unless it is at a junction where it cannot go in your direction, then it will pick
				a random direction perpendicular to you. If the gradient is between -1 and 1, I will move towards you along the X axis. If the gradient is less 
				than -1 or greater than 1, then it will move along the Y axis. This is assuming that is is able to do so. If it is at a corner or a straight line,
				then it will continue ‘forward’. A dead end is treated like a junction, except it can only go in one direction.
			</p>
			<p>
				The pink ghost is very similar to the red ghost, except at junctions. Where the option is available, the pink ghost favours going along the
				Y axis rather than the X axis when the gradient is between -1 and 1, and favours the X axis when the red would go along the Y. These two then 
				create an aspect of the ghosts being able to cut you off. The blue ghost however, is a combination of the red and pink ghost. Each time its
				functions run, it picks (at random) which function to use - the one for red or the one for pink. This is handy as there where / are areas of
				the game where the red and pink ghosts would end up getting stuck and going in loops should you stay still. The blue ghosts may take a while,
				but will get to you eventually, ensuring you can't keep going forever.
			</p>
			<p>
				The ghosts, particularly the orange one, makes use of several functions that support the decision-making process. They mostly just see 
				if the ghosts can exist at a certain position, or return a list of directions that the ghosts is allowed to go. One of them is IsCorner(),
				and it returns the number of positions that the ghost could go. if it is 2, then the ghosts will look further to see if it is a corner or
				straight line. if it is 1, then it will move backwards as it must be dead end. 3 or 4 are junctions and makes the above decisions to decide 
				which way to go
			</p>
			<p>
				When you click the play button, it runs a function that is only executed at the beginning of the game, and it ensures that the game is not
				already running. (There were glitches for some time that if you clicked the play button too many times, the ghosts would end up going faster.) 
				The main purpose of this start function is to set the default values to the global variables and then start two functions which once they are
				finished, set a timer to recall themselves. these two are the functions that run the player and the ghosts. When, for example, the player function runs,
				it calls the move player function. (The move player function does not call itself because it's easier to control. It also means that I can call that
				function more often without sleeping the game up.) Move player also then calls the function that updates the display, which ensures that the
				score is up to date. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When it calls itself, it can only do so if the Boolean value that shows weather or not the game is still active is true. Once this value is set to 
				false, the game will end as the functions that keep the game going will end and not restart. This means that you do not have to refresh the page to
				stop the timers, unlike some of my other games

			<h3>Outcome</h3>
			<p>
				One of the aspects of my website, which is good in some ways, but negative in others, is the fact that the ‘Website’ part exists all in the same webpage. I tried to do this because the Navigation bar, The footer, The header, and several other lines of code working in the background would be the same, only the content would need to change. So, I made each of these ‘pages’ actually a different <div> tag, and made them show (and hide the rest) when you click to access that ‘page’. Good aspects about it include the fact it saves time, and any edits to the nav bar don`t have to be copied 10 times, which could lead to inconsistencies and it not working on some pages. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The negative is mainly when you refresh the page, you would always come back to the home screen. In the intended use of the site, it does not cause any real issues, but when testing I may make small changes to one of the other pages and I had to keep changing to this page. I would cause an issue when I tried to add all my games to the same document with the site. As there are timers running, all but one of them make use of refreshing the page to stop these timers. If people are playing not-so-flappy dot and die, then they would have to navigate back to the game.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thinking about it, I could have a local storage container for the ‘page’, which would storage what page you are on. Then whenever the page loads, which is does after a refresh, it would check to see which page it should be on, according to the local storage… 
			</p>
			<p>
				Dotman, I think turned out very good. The code is designed to operate on any map, and there are other ones coded into the game, but only the one that is very similar to the real game is active. It’s this map that I was happy with. No other one I made I liked. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The ghosts have turned out to be very good, at catching you and running away. I had to have you start with 10 lives to give anyone a change to get to level two, although I have done a whole level in 1 life before. The ghosts also have a useful ‘glitch’ in them that I don`t bother to fix. As they have no way of knowing if they are going down a dead end, that you are not there for, they will repeatable go up and down at the beginning of the game. This means you can press play, but it is not until you press and arrow key to move away that they start coming for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				For Tetris, I feel that I cheated. The objects do not rotate, when you rotate, the original shape is lost and a new shape is generated at the same position, assuming that it does not collide with anything else.
			</p>
			<p>
				One this that I would say to people to encourage them to make their own games like these is that they; 
				<br>a) don`t require internet if you have the files, and;
				<br>b) They require a lot of ‘testing’ to ensure that it works correctly
